# GameBet 2.0 Build System Usage Examples

This document provides practical examples of using the GameBet 2.0 build, deploy, and package automation system.

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/1716/GameBet2.0-.git
cd GameBet2.0-
make install

# Full development workflow
make dev
```

### Production Release
```bash
# Create a production release
make prod

# Or step by step
make clean verify build package deploy-web deploy-android release
```

## 📋 Common Use Cases

### 1. Build for Testing
```bash
# Quick build for testing
npm run build

# Or with make
make build

# Verify build integrity
make test
```

### 2. Package for Distribution
```bash
# Create distribution packages
npm run package

# Check what was created
ls package/
# Output: android/ web/ complete/ package-info.json
```

### 3. Deploy to Different Environments

#### Staging Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy
# or
make deploy

# Files will be in deploy/staging/
```

#### Web Server Deployment
```bash
DEPLOY_TARGET=web npm run deploy
# or
make deploy-web

# Files will be in deploy/web/
# Includes .htaccess for Apache configuration
```

#### Android Store Deployment
```bash
DEPLOY_TARGET=android-store npm run deploy
# or
make deploy-android

# Files will be in deploy/android-store/
# Includes store-listing.json with metadata
```

### 4. Version Management

#### Automated Versioning
```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
make release-patch

# Minor release (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
make release-minor

# Major release (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
make release-major
```

#### Manual Versioning
```bash
# Create specific version
npm run release 2.1.0 minor

# Files will be in releases/v2.1.0/
```

## 🔧 Advanced Examples

### Custom Build Process
```bash
# Skip verification (faster for development)
make quick-build

# Custom deployment target
DEPLOY_TARGET=custom-target npm run deploy
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Environment variables for CI
export DEPLOY_TARGET=production
export NODE_ENV=production

# Run full pipeline
npm run verify && npm run build && npm run package && npm run deploy
```

### File Structure After Build

```

## 📱 Platform-Specific Deployment

### Google Play Store
1. Run Android deployment:
   ```bash
   make deploy-android
   ```

2. Upload files:
   - Upload `deploy/android-store/GameBet.aab` to Google Play Console
   - Upload `deploy/android-store/assetlinks.json` to your web server at `/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

3. Use metadata from `store-listing.json` for store listing

### Web Server (Apache)
1. Run web deployment:
   ```bash
   make deploy-web
   ```

2. Upload all files from `deploy/web/` to your web server
3. Ensure `.htaccess` file is processed by Apache
4. Verify `assetlinks.json` is accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

### Direct APK Distribution
1. Use `package/android/GameBet.apk` for direct distribution
2. Users need to enable "Install from Unknown Sources"
3. Provide checksums from `checksums.json` for verification

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Production
1. Regenerate signing keys:
   ```bash
   # Create new keystore (replace existing)
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore signing.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   ```

2. Update `signing-key-info.txt` with new credentials

3. Never commit production keys to public repositories

### For Development
- Current keystore is safe for development/testing
- Use environment variables for sensitive deployment configs

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
```bash
# Missing Java keytool
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk

# Missing Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Permission issues
chmod +x scripts/*.js

# Clean everything and restart
make clean-all
make install
make dev
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check environment
make status

# Verify all files
npm run verify

# Test build integrity
make test
```

## 📞 Support

- Build issues: Check `make status` and `npm run verify`
- Deployment issues: Review `DEPLOYMENT.md` files in deploy directories
- Release issues: Check `RELEASE_NOTES.json` in releases directory
- CI/CD issues: Review GitHub Actions logs
